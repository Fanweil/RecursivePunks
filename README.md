Recursive Punks is one of the first 10k Recursive ordinals collections. 
The original Punks are being recreated by combining different pre-inscribed traits. 
Mint is 100% free. Find the punk you want in the SVG folder and inscribe the SVG file to claim it.

To check if a Recursive Punk is already inscribed, go to <a href="https://ordinalsbot.com/" target="_blank">OrdinalsBot.com</a>, use the "Hash Check" and upload your svg. If OrdinalsBot is not working check the <a href="https://bitpunks.io/Explorer/Inscriptions">BitPunks explorer</a> (bottom left). If there are inscriptions on the right, the svg is already inscribed!</a></i></p>
